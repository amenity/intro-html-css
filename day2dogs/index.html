  				<p>Fay is a rescue I adopted two years ago. My 18 year old had just died, and I went to the animal shelter looking for another older dog. I tried out a few, but they all went ravenously after my chickens. So I settled for a puppy.</p>
  				<h3>Fay Facts</h3>
  				<ul>
  					<li><strong>Breed:</strong> Fay is very much a mutt...But I think she's very close in personality and looks to an <span class="breed"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Terrier">Irish Terrier</a></span>.
  					</li>
  					<li><strong>Temperment:</strong> Fay is aloof with other dogs and people. Of course she is devoted to me.</li>
  					<li><strong>Age:</strong> 2.5 years.</li>
  					<li><strong>Illness:</strong> Fay got Parvo soon after we got her.</li>
  				</ul>

	  			<h2>Hank</h2>
	  			<h4>a.k.a. "Hanko", "Hanker Chif", "Hank E.R. Chif"</h4>
	  			<div class="img-wrapper">
		  			<img src="Hank.jpg" alt="my other adorable dog" />

	  			</div>
  				<p>Someone found Hank in the winter, and decided to keep him in a cardboard box on their porch. Luckily the neighbors took him in and posted him on Craigslist. After Fay, 30 lbs, my husband wanted a "man's dog" â€” brindle or blue tick, big...I thought he <em>looked</em> big in the CL photo, but when we went to check him out, he was only 30lbs. All the same, we agreed he was a cutie and took him home.</p>
  				<h3>Hank Facts</h3>
  				<ul>
  					<li><strong>Breed:</strong> mixed up creature. Maybe <span class="breed">border collie</span>? Maybe <span class="breed"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_dog"> African Wild Dog</a></span>? I call him a "creature".
  					</li>
  					<li><strong>Temperment:</strong> So scared of toddlers! It's scary so I muzzle him when I take him out.(</li>
  					<li><strong>Age:</strong> 1.5 years.</li>
  					<li><strong>Illness:</strong> He got crazy fleas once. He wasn't even scratching, it was horrible</li>
